=================
Type of elements:
=================      
Inline Elements:
---------------
These elements get injected with other elements.

Block Level Elements:
---------------------
These elements take up their own space.

=================
Forms:
=================      
Attributes:
-----------
method - It is the way how the form is going to be transported.

action - It is the place where the form is going.

get / GET - For get forms, the inserted form data is shown in the url. It is mainly used to fetch some data from the server. For GET, the page is not usually redirected to a new page, unless configured as such.

post / POST - For post forms, the inserted form data is not shown in the url. It is used to post the data in the server DB. For POST, the page gets redirected by default.

input:
------
type - defines the type of input form.

name - This identifies the input form uniquely.

placeholder - This works as a place holder in the input form and once clicked it goes away.

value - This works similar to placeholder but instead of going away when clicked, it stays there and kind of acts as a default value for the input form.

readonly - This is a boolean tag, if it is there then that input form cannot be edited.

checkbox: We can select multiple options in case of checkboxs.

checked - This boolean attribute makes a checkbox checked by default.

radio: We can select any one from the provided radio buttons.

- Give the same name to all checkboxes and radio buttons to make them associated with each other.

- While using checkboxes and radio boxes use the id in the for attribute of the label to make it associated with the boxes and once from is submitted, the value is sent to the server.

label:
------
- This is mainly used for screen readers.

for - This determines for which input form this label is created. When screen readers click on it, it automatically selects the input form having the same name as the value in the for attribute of the label tag.

Button:
------
type - This defines the special functionality of the button. For submit type, it submits all the values in the form and throws it in the server.

Personal Notes
++++++++++++++++++++++      
- Embedding pages using iframes is a huge security risk.
- For adding depth we add box-shadow.
- Navigation menus are created using unordered list.
- While Analysing a web page divide it into rows and columns and try to figure out how you wold divide it into a table.
- CSS Conflicts: For CSS and HTML the order that they are placed in affects the o/p. That means the later part will overwrite the previous parts. [css link (orderly) > <style> > inline]
- ID should only be used for only 1 element and classes can be used for multiple elements in HTML and CSS.
- z-index determines which element will be on top of which element in a web page.
- It is recommended that for mobile view, give padding from left and right. Top and bottom are not necessary.
